# Merk Coding Challenge

This submission is divided into two sections, corresponding to the sections of the challenge. To get started evaluating, simply clone the repository (I recommend PyCharm, but it should work in any IDE that runs Python) and navigate to each section for grading and running the scripts. Below is the information you need to evaluate each section.

### Section 1 - PyPlate Notebook
For best results, open a terminal in the Section 1 folder and run the <code>jupyter notebook</code> command. If you aren't wanting to run the notebook in a jupyter server, the Merk_Coding_Challenge.ipynb file should still render in your IDE (you may need to install plugins, but in PyCharm it worked fine). If rendering in your IDE, the output for the code cell will render the generated tables after all of the text output instead of incorporating them as intended, but if that's fine then you don't need to spin up a jupyter server.

### Section 2 - Rainbow Scripts
The cloned repository will come with the csv_files folders already present for evaluation. If you want to regenerate them using the scripts, you will have to delete them in your own project and then run the scripts. They are in separate folders and have the names X_main.py, where X is one of [pear, scale, sixtysix]. 

Thank you for your consideration! You will find my resume in this project and if you have any questions please email me at mosecodes@gmail.com.
